TODO

 - Replace malloc with calloc
 - Implement AES-GCM support (use NI) or make comparable with OpenSSH?
 - Implement simply variable-length buffer
 - Write nice (easy to read and extend) tests
 - Integrate into OpenSSH
 - Decide on interface to decryption. Should we take care of managing how much we have encrypted already?
   * if yes, this would make it a lot easier to use, but also might give a timing signal (see below)
 - Add guards for calling functions too many times (data limits)


 NOTES

 - Per packet timing leak is bad
 - Per chunk timing leak is ok 
 - Had to disable block length check. How to get around this???


 PAPER

 - Document design decisions 
 - Discuss why we can't do exponential forecating 
 - Discuss why are we trying to acheive boundary hidinng
 - Pseudo descriptions 
 - Discuss what the strategy should be when the decryption function returns
   * Should we copy data right away or wait for the whole ciphertext to be decrypted?
   * waitiing might give a timing signal becuase it suddently takes time to copy (maybe a lot of data)
