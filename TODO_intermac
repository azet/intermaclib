TODO

 - Implement MAKE file
 - Implement clean up functions (function pointers in general cipher struct)
 - Refactor to constant time online encryption/decryption
 - Implement simply variable-length buffer
 - Write nice (easy to read and extend) tests
 - Integrate into OpenSSH
 - Add guards for calling functions too many times (data limits)
 - Make more portable with size_t instead of u_int (or understand what is the difference)
 - Licencse?

 - (DONE) Implement AES-GCM support (use NI) or make comparable with OpenSSH?


 NOTES

 - Per packet timing leak is bad
 - Per chunk timing leak is ok 
 - Had to disable block length check. How to get around this???
 - ChaCha-Poly construction follows https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539


 PAPER

 - Document design decisions 
 - Discuss why we can't do exponential forecating 
 - Discuss why are we trying to acheive boundary hidinng
 - Pseudo descriptions 
 - Discuss what the strategy should be when the decryption function returns
   * Should we copy data right away or wait for the whole ciphertext to be decrypted?
   * waitiing might give a timing signal becuase it suddently takes time to copy (maybe a lot of data)
